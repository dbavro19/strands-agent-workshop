All FAQs about Account Details
What information is available on the account detail pages?
You can view a list of investments, change in balance for the past eight (8) quarters, details on contributions and vesting rules, and transaction history for the past two (2) quarters.

How is the contribution source determined?
Each time a contribution is applied to your account, we identify where the contribution came from (you or your employer) and if it is pre-tax or post-tax money.

Why isn't my vested balance shown?
If a vested balance doesn't show, it means an account doesn't subscribe to our service that tracks vested balances. We require that service to ensure the accuracy of the figures.
